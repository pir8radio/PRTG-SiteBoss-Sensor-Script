# PRTG-SiteBoss-Sensor-Script

This repository provides a PowerShell script for integrating [SiteBoss](https://www.asentria.com/products/siteboss/) network device data with the PRTG Network Monitor system. The script queries the SiteBoss REST API, retrieves sensor data, and outputs results in an XML format readable by PRTG as a custom sensor.

## Features

- **Authenticates with the SiteBoss API** using provided credentials.
- **Retrieves dashboard data** including all available sensors.
- **Dynamically generates PRTG XML output** for each sensor/channel.
- **Supports custom units and lookups** for channel values.
- **Temperature channel alerting** with configurable warning and error thresholds.
- **Handles SSL certificate warnings** (useful for self-signed device certs).
- **Graceful error handling** with descriptive messages for PRTG.

## Requirements

- PowerShell 5.1 or newer (Windows Server recommended for PRTG integration).
- PRTG Network Monitor (must support custom/exe/script sensors).
- SiteBoss device with REST API v1 endpoints enabled.

## Usage

The script is intended to be run by PRTG as a custom EXE/Script sensor.

### Arguments

```
SiteBoss_API_v2.ps1 <host> <username> <password>
```

- `<host>`: Hostname or IP address of the SiteBoss device (do not include protocol).
- `<username>`: Username for SiteBoss API authentication.
- `<password>`: Password for SiteBoss API authentication.

### Example (manual test)

```powershell
.\SiteBoss_API_v2.ps1 192.168.1.100 admin "MySecretPassword"
```

### Integration with PRTG

1. Copy `SiteBoss_API_v2.ps1` to the `Custom Sensors\EXEXML` directory on your PRTG Probe system.
2. Copy `custom.prtgc.lookup.siteboss.rest.sensorstate.ovl` to the `lookups/custom` directory on your PRTG core(s).
3. Copy `SiteBoss (v2).odt` to the `devicetemplates` directory on your PRTG core(s).
4. In the PRTG web interface, add a new "EXE/Script Advanced" sensor to your SiteBoss device.
5. Select `SiteBoss_API_v2.ps1` as the script, and add the required SiteBoss API parameters (`%host <sb-username> "<sb-password>"`) in the sensor settings (%host will use the ip or dns name of the parent) and select "Auto discovery with template" and select the `SiteBoss (v2)` template.
6. Save and test the sensor.

## Output

- Returns `<prtg>` XML with a `<result>` for each detected sensor/channel.
- For temperature, includes PRTG limit settings for automatic warning/error alerts.
- When an error occurs, returns a PRTG-formatted error message for easy troubleshooting.

## Security

- The script disables SSL certificate validation to support self-signed certs; use with caution.
- Credentials are passed as arguments (plain text in PRTG), so restrict permissions on the script and sensor or use the script placeholders.

## Customization

- **Temperature limits** (warning/error) can be adjusted in the script under the "Temperature channel" section.
- **Sensor lookup**: Custom lookup ID is `custom.prtgc.lookup.siteboss.rest.sensorstate.ovl`. Ensure your PRTG server has this lookup defined if using custom states.
- **Device Template**: Included my device template `SiteBoss (v2).odt`, may not be what you want, but something you can edit to make work however you want.
